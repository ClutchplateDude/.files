### Dircolors Test

Directory of all types of files highlighted by dircolors.

Run `make` to chmod the files to the correct type. This is necessary because git removes some of these file settings and types -- with good reason!

Run `make nod` to copy dev/null to this directory (a nod file)

Also remember to not ever write data to a `nod` file. They can overwrite your filesystem.
