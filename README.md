# .files

People kept asking me for my configuration files so I figured I'd put 'em up here...

##Custom stuff

    .zshrc                # My config with LOTS of macros, color settings
    .king.zsh-theme       # My custom zshrc theme designed for royalty
    .gitconfig            # Git is amazing

## Custom system stuff

    .links                # Setup my soft links for my system
    .osx                  # Custom osx configuration script

##From other folks

    .oh-my-zsh            # Bandwagons are fun! Come aboard.
    .dircolors            # http://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized
    .dirfiles_test        # My test dir for dircolors. Run `make` to see it for reals.
