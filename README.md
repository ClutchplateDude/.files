# .files

People kept asking me for my configuration files so I figured I'd put 'em up here...

##Custom stuff

    zsh/zshrc                # My config with LOTS of macros, color settings
    zsh/king.zsh-theme       # My custom zshrc theme designed for royalty
    git/gitconfig            # Git is amazing

## Custom system stuff

    files.bash            # Setup my soft links for my .files system
    osx/osx.bash          # Custom osx configuration script

## Vanilla script

Getting started? This is a simple list for people who need to be up and running fast.

    bash_profile          # Simple bash script (git, colors, paths)
    dircolors             # Customize directory colors using ls
    SolarizedDark.theme   # OSX terminal theme. Must install Total Terminal
    SolarizedLight.theme  # OSX terminal theme. Must install Total Terminal

## Personal Install Steps'

## Special Thanks

My config wouldn't be anything without standing on the shoulders of giants.

    zsh/oh-my-zsh         # Bandwagons are fun! Come aboard.
